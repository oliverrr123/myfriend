In the United States, 16.2 million seniors live completely alone. That's more people than the entire population of several U.S. states combined. Many of them rarely see their family, or not at all, and loneliness becomes part of their daily life.

That's why I'm buliding [MyFriend](https://growbyte.co/myfriend).

MyFriend has a phone number that you can call any time just to chat, or get some help solving a hard problem. He can also call you on his own initiative to check how you are doing, or to remind you of an important event, like taking your medications or going to the doctor.
